INTRODUCTION:
"The handicap of deafness is not in the ear; it is in the mind.". The design and project are for Deaf people and are presented to improve their lives. We have a responsibility to guide them through the right path and development to achieve social and economic progress. In this paper, we build a machine learning-based approach to predict the possible job opportunities for deaf people based on certain attributes. Our sound alert system has the capability to reach out to deaf people alone without any side effects. We have also added an emergency answering platform for deaf people. Our model shows substantial potential and is easily accessible, and the prototype will be implemented using the Figma tool. In order to strengthen social bonds and let deaf people participate in various community activities, Deaf awareness is important because, at its most fundamental level, it facilitates a bridge between hearing and deaf people, which will create a more diverse and open society.

OUR OBJECTIVE:
Our project’s industry or market application is focused on those who are hearing and speech impaired. It’s more of a solution to a social problem for this specific group of people. This service can aid a person living with hearing loss and help them participate in society or the community.
